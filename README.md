# Etch-a-Sketch
This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. It's a pretty nice toy.
<br><br>
Building this project basically helped me in flexing my DOM manipulation skills.<br>
It's a pretty simple project which lets you draw on the sketch-pad. Feel free to check it out here: https://niranjana-mr.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/
